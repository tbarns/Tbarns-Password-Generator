# password-generator

## Description
I was tasked to use JavaScript to create a password generator that prompted the user to select the characters they wanted to include as well as the length of the password. 
This application presented several challenges.  I needed to turn the userâ€™s choice of the password length from a string into a number.  Additionally, I needed to take in all the characters the user selected and generate a random choice that reflected the choices the specified.
